# ios-design-patterns
A sample project from Ray Wenderlich that demonstrates some common design patterns used in iOS - Just adding it here for my own reference in future.

See the originals here - Part 1:

Part 2:
https://www.raywenderlich.com/476-design-patterns-on-ios-using-swift-part-2-2

It takes a look at these patterns:

* MVC
* The Singleton
* The Facade Design Pattern - API that returns from local storage or network etc
* The Decorator Design Pattern - Extensions & Delegation
* The Adaptor Pattern - Using Protocals
* The Observer Pattern - Notifications and KVO
* The Momento Pattern for Archiving
